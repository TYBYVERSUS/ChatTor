I might update this periodically when things get done or I think of new things that need to be done

Top Priority:

Websocket Server (C):
 - Add feature for users to change their names without leaving and re-entering
 - Figure out how to implement a secure trip-code feature in a way that can't be used to DoS me
 - Figure out how to set custom colors for specific username/trip-code combinations in a way that is easy to edit (doesn't require recompiling)
 - Possibly other stuff I'm forgetting
 - Audit, test, and optimize

Website (HTML/JS/CSS):
 - Add room-dependent UI options that allow users to:
   * Clear the chat log
   * Leave a room as an identity (close the chat tab)
   * Change their username without leaving and coming back
   * Invite a user in another room to this current room
   * Add "messages" option to mention when a user enters/leaves/changes name/etc
   * Notification sound when something happens (disabled by default, please use something free as in freedom) (possibly different sounds for different things?)
   * Option to auto-scroll chat messages
   * Option to toggle "last read" line (enabled by default)
 - Start deleting chat logs after 500 messages/notifications
 - Add a "last read" line showing the users what the last message was before they changed tabs
 - Add green text (Messages like ">Message" will appear as green. The color code is still probably in the CSS)
 - Create a UI mechanism for handling recieved invites (New + tab that is yellow?). Should not create new tabs for duplicate invites
 - Create a feature to change theme without reloading page (Dynamically load CSS files with JS maybe?)
 - Create at least one other theme that isn't so high-contrast
 - Mobile compatibility (use the OrBot app)
 - Gracefully handle being disconnected and reconnect after a few (3? 5?) seconds
 - Little things to make it better (I have a few in mind I'll just do myself)
 - Make newlines work in chat messages (<pre> maybe?)
 - Possibly other stuff I'm forgetting
 - Audit, test, and optimize



Normal Priority:

Websocket Server (C):
 - Add housekeeping functions to the housekeeping thread (PING/PONG, rebalancing trees, etc)
 - Possibly convert hardcoded if/else ladder in while(poll()) loop in threads.c into a BST that reads functions from module .o files at start up?
 - Possibly create a module to create an admin console accessible on the server to perform administrative tasks (kick users, lock rooms, etc)?
 - Useful stuff I can't think of at this exact moment?


Website (HTML/JS/CSS):
 - Make some addition visually appealing themes, maybe for holidays or special occasions?
 - Useful stuff I can't think of at this exact moment?
